    "In this project we'll be creating how to build a full-featured web application from the ground up using the FastAPI framework in Python. We'll build both a JSON API for programmatic access and HTML pages for users to browse in the browser. Throughout the series, we'll set up a database with SQLAlchemy, create Pydantic models for data validation, and implement complete CRUD operations. We'll add user registration and login with secure password hashing and JWT tokens, handle file uploads for profile pictures, use background tasks for sending emails, and organize our code properly with routers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first video, we'll keep things simple. We'll install FastAPI, create a basic application, build a couple of routes that return JSON, run the app from the command line, and explore FastAPI's automatic documentation. Then we'll add some dummy data, create an API endpoint, and preview returning HTML responses. Let's get started..."

    "A Application Programming Interface is a way for programs to talk to each other, it conncets clients and servers. When a client asks for something such as a web page an API allows that request to be passed on to the server which stores that web page and returns it to the client. \n",

    "When you type a URL in the browser like google.com your browser sends a `request` to Google's server asking for a webpage. The server sends back a response (the webpage). \n",
